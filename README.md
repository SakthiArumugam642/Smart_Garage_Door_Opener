# Smart_Garage_Door_Opener
In this project we will create a prototype of a smart garage door system. In order to do so we have used a sensor to validate if the person is authorized to enter the garage or not. This being said on the IoT side we have added a wifi module to connect the device to the internet and monitor the accessing of the garage door. To finish it up we have also given the person access to open the garage without the requirement of any validation by the sensor. This is provided by virtually connecting the motor that opens and closes the garage door to the users mobile app and the webpage.
